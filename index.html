        <h2><b><u>Rules</u></b></h2>
        <p>Work on assigned projects. Not everyday, but a                 kinda constant amount working time is prefered.                Please talk to the owners about not be able to                 work for reasons, and if you just don't feel                   like it. We will find a way to find replacements                for that particular assignment. If we can't find                a replacement. The owners will personally work                 on them just so every worker is happy and not                  stressed. Owners will help out in every way to                 help with everyone's assignments so no one will                be overwhelmed.</p>   
            <p><b><i><strong><strong>MOST IMPORTANT RULE!!!</strong></strong></i></b></p>
            <p><b><i>PLEASE HAVE FUN!!!</i></b> Mostly we want workers to                   enjoy their working space. We don't want our                   workers ever unhappy. If there is ever a fight,                or you are not happy with something in your                    working space please contact one of the owners                 .</p>
